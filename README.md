# Perun
Perun chess engine.

## Why?

I always wanted to make a chess engine, that's why. 

## What is different about this one?

This engine has no unmake move generation(If it generates a move it is 100% legal). Initiali wanted to create MCTS search but after deeper reasearch decided to stick to classic alpha beta pruning. Nothing more special about Perun, i guess, but might do some wierd things in the future.

History:
- 2/11/2024 - First ever search. (depth 8, played polish opening)
- 2/18/2024 - First tests with [STS](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Strategic_Test_Suite), failed all c:
