## Current plans
 - create mvv-lva constexpr table
 - create function for move scoring
 - reasearch speed differences between std::algorithm and simple insertion sort
 - research if move ordering is only for quiesce search or also for main alpha beta

## Big plans
 + Move ordering for quiesce search
 + Create threefold repetition detection
 + Implement aspiration windows
 + Implement primary variation storing
